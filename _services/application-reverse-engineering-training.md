We understand the unfortunate, yet common scenario whereby a technical leader exits an organization without appropriately transferring knowledge to the remaining staff.  With our breadth of experience deploying and maintaining large production installations, our team can efficiently reverse-engineering your architecture, and provide the training to your remaining team in order to fill knowledge gaps or upskill current team members on the infrastructure you have deployed today.
