Standardizing and simplifying your development & deployment processes can be difficult. Docker provides a unique solution by allowing a pre-configured, ready-to-run application/service to be bundled into a Docker container. These containers are standardized across environments and platforms, and can be used from local development, through production. Placing your application  in Docker typically improves the ability and turnaround for CI/CD as well. Most existing apps/services can be “Dockerized” to enjoy the benefits of this new methodology.
