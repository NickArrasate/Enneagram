client_testimonial_title: "A Word From BriteBee"
client_testimonial: "Bowtie is one of the most down to earth and approachable firms I have come across. They were with me from the very beginning stages of the company. From the first 5 ideas we pitched to actual product launch, Bowtie was with our company the who way. They are extremely founder friendly and the contract is straight forward and generous.
They helped us hire our first in house developer and it was a huge win! Nothing bad to say... No one is perfect, but when there was problem it was quickly addressed. We are grateful for the such amazing service and ultimately a wonderful friendship."
