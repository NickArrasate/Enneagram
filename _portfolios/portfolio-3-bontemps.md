  Bon temps came to us with an idea long before they even had a brand name. They
  envisioned an experience for their customers that echoed unique attributes for
  their brand concept and were uncompromising, much like the quality of their
  product. They had an incredible business idea with high standards for design
  and UX.

  We built a custom shopify site with tools they need to grow in the first few
  years of their new business. We also provided technical consultation and
  support throughout the early branding and design process and acted as a
  sounding board for the company’s leadership regarding all things tech.

We spent several months serving as a technical advisor while Bon Temps did initial market research and brand development. Once design was complete, we produced a custom Shopify site and built to suit theme, ensuring smooth transition from inception to launch.
