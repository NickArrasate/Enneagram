title: Bold Betties Data Dashboard
subtitle: Managing a 40,000 Member Adventure Organization
intro-copy: >-
  Bold Betties is a female founded and operated company, changing the face of
  adventure. What began as a Colorado Meetup of women exploring the outdoors
  together, is now an international organization with chapters in dozens of
  cities, representing over 40,000 members. Bowtie developed the Bold Betties
  tool kit app, which pulled together data from multiple systems to make it easier to
  recruit and retain members, and to organize and manage trips. Our solution is
  powering the Bold Betties next wave of growth.

  With over 40,000 members in 60 cities and growing, the Bold Betties needed a
  way to keep their community-driven member chapters in sync. Additionally, they
  wanted actionable insight into their chapters to assist growth and foster
  stronger community engagement. Our challenge was to unify member processes to
  enable organization during a period of high growth and bring together
  disparate systems to unify data for better analysis and insight.

  Using Ruby on Rails and a custom ETL, we centralized disconnected data into a
  single system and data warehouse to capture and analyze the information they
  were gathering in multiple user management and acquisition sites that they did
  not own. This allowed us to visualize and export more useful data. We also
  built a tool for community leader recruitment and event creation, as well as
  consulting with their organization with repeat training and ongoing support. Bold Betties now has a single system that leverages the Meetup API for user acquisition, Shopify API for eCommerce, and a custom dashboard for member and event management and leadership recruitment.

We spent several months diving into the organizational processes, learning every aspect and workflow. After hearing their solutions and suggestions we worked with them to strip back repetition and reduce inefficiency in the Bold Betties member growth, event management, and eCommerce processes. We were also able to suggest new methods of data capture and analysis that led to a more comprehensive organizational view.
