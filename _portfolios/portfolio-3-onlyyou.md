OnlyYOU is a groundbreaking new genetic testing service. With a simple cheek swab DNA test, they can tell you how your body processes every major pharmaceutical on the market.

Bowtie developed an elegant HIPPA/HITEC web application to process customer orders, share select information with customers' doctors, and display test results. We also developed an administrative interface to manage orders at the testing facility, a native mobile application, and assisted with brand and identity development.
