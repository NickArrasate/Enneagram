  Pangea is a 17 year old brand with millions of loyal fans and customers. They
  approached us as they planned to launch several new brands
  into the Pangea family including skin care, tea, and castile soap.  We
  assisted with a complete technical overhaul that helped establish the new brands
  and simplify their business processes.

  Pangea had challenges supporting a multibrand theme with their original platform, and back of house processes connecting to many points of sale including B2C, wholesale, and Amazon. Our
  goal was to develop a dynamic Multibrand Shopify Theme and help streamline their systems while building a beautiful new site that maintains a distinct brand experience for each of 5 very different brands.
result_copy: >-
  A ground breaking and unique multibrand Shopify theme that allows Pangea to
  represent many brands in a unique context with the sophistication of an
  enterprise level site. We chose Shopify to give them more in-house flexibility
  and creative control, because as an award winging brand, their marketing and
  art departments need to enact precise control and respond very quickly to
  customer trends and needs.

<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> extensive on boarding process of shadowing every aspect of Pangea’s business, looking at existing and new business. We produced a technical roadmap for a multi-brand store, allowing extensive cross promotion and pleasing user experience for their customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Design: </strong>we carefully designed each brand to look and function as separate sites while tying back to the Pangea family and ethos. Bowtie did all of the site design for each brand in conjunction with Pangea’s creative director.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation:</strong> We produced a multi-brand Shopify site to replace their Big Commerce consumer site and revamped a number of behind the scenes practices to ensure consistent inventory and supply for multiple warehouses across multiple sales channels. This led to streamlined processes and simplified a lot of in-house work that is done by the client.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Post Launch:</strong> We also provided extensive training to ensure they could operate all of their new tools independently and without difficulty.</p>
