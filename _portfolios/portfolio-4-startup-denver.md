Startup Denver gives every startup with a crazy idea and enough hubris to get in front of a crowd of judges five minutes to sell their idea to the world. They represent one of the largest monthly Startup groups in Denver, and maintain a mastermind group and successful co-working space.

Bowtie developed an event website for the group and is actively developing an application the Startup Denver crowd will use to up vote ideas during pitch battles.
