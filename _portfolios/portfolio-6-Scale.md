When Ombud was hosting their Inaugural user conference, they sought out a solid design and host for their site. SCALE was a two day conference focused on hands on training, thought leadership, educational sessions, and networking.

Bowtie developed an event website for the group and trained Ombud staff on the Bowtie CMS for up to the date content modifications before and during the conference.
