The BowTie client runs on your development machine and allows you to preview changes locally before pushing to BowTie. It is similar to the Jekyll client (and is built upon it), but includes support for BowTieâ€™s user management, policies, environments, and payments features. To install, run `gem install bowtie-io` from your command line.
&nbsp;

You can download the BowTie client on our [github page](http://github.com/bowtie-io/bowtie-io). For more information on the client visit our [getting started guide](/help/getting-started-with-bowtie/), or  [read our docs](https://bowtie.io/docs/#setup).
