client_testimonial: "We’ve worked with Bowtie over the last ten months to rebuild and enhance the application that handles our membership records and to redesign our website. Working with them has truly been a pleasure. They put in significant time to understand our needs and brought a high level of intelligence and skill to design. They’re just great people to work with as well, very warm and real."
