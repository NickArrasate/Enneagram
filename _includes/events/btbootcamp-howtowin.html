      <h3>What we'll cover:</h3>
      <br>
      <p>When you launch a project on BowTie, you get a private github repo, <a href="http://info.ssl.com/article.aspx?id=10241" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SSL</a> certificate, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">DNS</a> configuration all with the click of a button. No more waiting hours for the boring stuff to get set up. Set up your dev environment and install the BowTie client to <a href="/help/getting-started-with-bowtie/">get started</a>.</p>
<br>

      <h4>Building</h4>
      <p>BowTie is push to deploy. Install the BowTie client to work locally. Many applications won't require a database. If you need to access/store data, checkout our static data files, or user profiles. You probably want to start by taking a look at your <a href="/help/bowtie-site-configuration/">default settings</a>.</p>
      <p> We provide Jekyll for a fully configured <a href="/help/blogging-with-bowtie/">markdown blog</a>. Upload your images to the `/img` directory, embed videos, and use preconfigured components to take advanatge of services like addthis and disqus. Take a look at the `_includes` directory to see what's possible.</p>

        <h4>Styling</h4>
        <p>If you're focused on styling we recommend you hit up <a href="/help/style-customize-bowtie-frontend/">this user guide</a>, and focus your energy on the `_sass` directory. This contains a `theme.scss` file loaded with variables to make styling your site really quick. You can also use bootstrap, jquery, and fontawesome, which are baked in by default.</p>

        <h4>Third Party Services</h4>
        <p>Does your app need payments? Stripe payments and subscription plans are baked in - and you can set policies to create paywalls with ease. Looking to extend BowTie even further? Use the <a href="/help/using-bowtie-with-zapier/">BowTie Zapier integration</a> to connect user events to hundreds of third-party services, like mailing list software, CRMs, and more.</p>

        <h4>Team Integration</h4>
        <p>Development is all about teamwork. With BowTie, you can add team members to your project to start collaborating instantly.</p>
