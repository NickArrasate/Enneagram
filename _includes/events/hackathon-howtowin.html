      <h4>Development Lead </h4>
      <p>BowTie automatically configures your domain, SSL, and gives you a private git repo with easy team access. We recommend you 'own' the main project, and help your team <a href="/help/getting-started-with-bowtie/">get started</a> so they can contribute. BowTie is push to deploy. the CLI, Install the BowTie client to work locally. Many applications won't require a database. If you need to access/store data, checkout our static data files, or user profiles.</p>

      <h4>Styling</h4>
      <p>If you're focused on styling we recommend you hit up <a href="/help/style-customize-bowtie-frontend/">this user guide</a>, and focus your energy on the `_sass` directory. This contains a `theme.scss` file loaded with variables to make styling your site really quick. You can also use bootstrap, jquery, and fontawesome, which are baked into BowTie by default.</p>

      <h4>Content Person</h4>
      <p>If you are focusing on content creation, you'll appreciate how easy it is to author static content on BowTie. You probably want to start by taking a look at your <a href="/help/bowtie-site-configuration/">default settings</a>. We provide Jekyll for a fully configured <a href="/help/blogging-with-bowtie/">markdown blog</a>. Upload your images to the `/img` directory, embed videos, and use preconfigured components to take advanatge of services like addthis and disqus. Take a look at the `_includes` directory to see what's possible.</p>

      <h4>Third Party Services</h4>
      <p>Does your app need payments? Stripe payments and subscription plans are baked in - and you can set policies to create paywalls with ease. Looking to extend BowTie even further? Use the <a href="/help/using-bowtie-with-zapie/r">BowTie Zapier integration</a> to connect user events to hundreds of third-party services, like mailing list software, CRMs, and more.</p>
