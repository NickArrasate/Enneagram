<p>Hack the Dot is a two-hour hackathon backed by<a href="https://name.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" rel="noopener"> Name.com</a>. The event is a unique mix of hacking, community building, and ridiculous fun. &nbsp; <a href="https://hack.social/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" rel="noopener"><img class="third pull-left right-buffer" style="border: none; box-shadow: none;" src="/img/events/htd-black.png" alt="Hack the dot logo - name.com" /></a></p>
<p>Participants are asked to show up and ship a project based on a _secret domain name_ revealed the night of the event. The theme at Hack the Dot Portland, hosted by <a href="https://quickleft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" rel="noopener">QuickLeft</a>, was '<em>hippo.haus</em>' - which not surprisingly, yielded high energy and hilarious projects. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Bowtie has been supporting Hack the Dot with a special 'pitch page' template that's helped lead more than one team to victory. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If you didn't join us in Denver, Seattle, or Portland, you can still meet us at <a href="//hack.social/events/sanfrancisco/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" rel="noopener">Hack the Dot - San Francisco</a> on December 10th. The event is sold out, but you can register for the wait list <a href="//hack.social/events/sanfrancisco/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" rel="noopener">here</a>. *<em> I'm also fairly certain that if you show up day of, no one will toss you out ;)</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
