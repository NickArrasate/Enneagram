<p dir="ltr">Technology is amazing. Every year we discover new ways to automate mundane tasks and simplify the creation of everything that humans produce.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The web is no exception. We also find new tools to tell our brand story, and connect with an increasingly more connected audience. Nearly every day a new tool comes along to strengthen the voice or promotion of your brand, and to make it easier for customers to show their support.</p>

<p dir="ltr">If you&rsquo;re a business owner there&rsquo;s a good chance you have bootstrapped your way through dozens of DIY tools to serve your back of house and front of house efforts. Surely as I type this, thousands of you are leveraging learning a new online tool to build your own website or ecommerce store.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While there is certainly a time and place to use DIY site builders, as you grow, those tools will begin to fail your customers. If you&rsquo;re reading this post, chances are you might also have reached the inflection point where you are realizing that the ROI of DIY isn&rsquo;t always what it once was. Or perhaps you&rsquo;re stuck trying to provide an experience that speaks to your community, and your tool or skill set is incapable of achieving?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Or you may have grown to a level where the risk of DIY and not knowing how to do what you need to is hurting your business or creating customer service headaches. Don&rsquo;t panic. This happens to nearly every business. Brands grow, needs change, and hopefully your customer base is keeping up with that growth even if your website has not.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you&rsquo;re tired of feeling out of your element and/or unable to efficiently execute your online presence &ndash; congratulations! You&rsquo;ve leveled up. You&rsquo;re ready to pass the torch to a team of professionals who can help take your vision to the level that you are taking your business.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As a business owner and homeowner, I&rsquo;m happy to get my hands dirty in many DIY pursuits. Although I try not to spend my time doing anything I&rsquo;m uncomfortable with, especially if I could be building new revenue using my core competencies.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At Bowtie.co, we take a unique approach to learning your mission, understanding your needs, and proposing solutions that fit the needs of your community.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We are a web development company. We build websites and e-commerce stores every day. Web design and development are second nature to us because we have spent thousands of hours solving similar problems over and over. And we&rsquo;re remarkably good at picking up other developer&rsquo;s work and fixing short comings.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you&rsquo;re feeling the pinch of outgrowing DIY, let&rsquo;s work together to get your technology in a more efficient, effective, and profitable place for your business this year.</p>
