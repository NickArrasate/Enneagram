With over 13,700 community members in attendance, Denver Startup Week has grown to become the largest event of its kind in North America. Powered by the local community, Denver Startup Week represents the very best in tech, design, DIY-making, marketing and leadership.

We were extremely pleased to be selected to produce "Don't Reinvent the Wheel" - selected by community members from over 940 talks. Scott Maloney and Chad Person join representatives from SendGrid and Spire Digital to discuss the age old paradigm of buy vs build.

### Synopsis:

*Even the simplest products have a lot of moving pieces. It’s tempting to want to build and own each one. Don’t fall into this trap. In this panel we’ll hear from SaaS founders who leveraged existing infrastructure, tools, and open source resources to get MVPs out the door faster. Learn what worked, what didn’t, and what to expect as you develop your first product.*




The panel discussion takes place **Thursday, September 15, 2016, 2:00pm – 3:20pm.**

At the **Colorado Lending Source, 1441 18th St, Denver, CO**

We hope to see you there!
