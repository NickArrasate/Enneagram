<p>Our founder Chad Person is participating on a panel discussion with Matt Vogels from Webflow _(now [Zestful](https://zestful.com/))_, and Jason Waldrip from [Brand Folder](https://www.brandfolder.com/), for a discussion about creativity, originality, and inspiration in the age of ubiquitous frameworks and technology designed to do your job for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Join us for a discussion sure to rouse your mind, ignite your senses, and light a fire under your standing desk. _"If you can make anything, why make anything at all..."_ will take place at the *DVLP/DNVR* conference on *August 4th, 2016*. &nbsp; For more information, visit [the Develop/Denver](https://developdenver.org/)</p>
