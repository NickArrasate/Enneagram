<p>Whether you are a professional designer or an aspiring creative who gets lost in weekend projects, Adobe is calling you to Albuquerque, New Mexico on January 28th for a Creative Jam. What exactly is a <a href="http://www.adobecreativejams.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" rel="noopener">Creative Jam</a>? The Adobe Creative Cloud team will host the Creative Jam presentations. This one-hour design showcase highlights the work of local creative leaders. At the same time, in the next room, Designers will be competing in the Creative Jam tournament, a 3-hour design charrette showdown. This event will have two categories: Visual Design and Motion Design. Once the Creative Jam presentations wrap, tournament participants will take the stage to share their creations with you. As part of the audience, you&rsquo;ll vote on each submission and select the People's Choice winner. There will also be Grand Prize winners decided by a group of Judges! &nbsp;</p>
